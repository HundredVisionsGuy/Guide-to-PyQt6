Add some form validation functions
Display a warning if any of the following occurs:
    * email doesn't match common guidelines for emails
    * the passwords are not equal
    * the password does not meet the minimum length requirement
        (min: 8 characters) 
        + hint: len()
    * the password does not include a number or symbol:
        + you could loop through a string of numbers and check
            that there is at least one match.
            Hint: if i in password
        + you could do the same with symbols.
        OR
        + you could use a regular expression

# Create your form validation functions using a top-down approach
